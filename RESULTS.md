# Results

After the Russian military attack on Ukraine 24 Feb 2022, the interest in the Wikipedia article about Nato exploded across languages. This study is based on a 
comparison of the average daily reads of the Nato article during ten days starting 24.2.2022 ("recent"), with the average daily reads during the six years 2016-2021 ("baseline").

## The interest exploded

The interest exploded by a factor of 58 in English, 63 in French, and 78 in German. The factors grow even more in Croat (120), Swedish (112) and Finnish (122). Nearly 
all languages show similar numbers.

## The interest is highest in Nordics and Baltics

However, the growth factor is likely not the most significant factor. The number of reads needs to be put into proportion, weighing in the number of native speakers.

The result here is dramatic. The top two languages for interest in the Nato article during the ten days starting with the Russian invasion of Ukraine are not spoken
in any current Nato country: Finnish and Swedish. These languages already ranked 2 and 5 for 2016-2021, with Estonian ranking 1, Latvian 3, and Norwegian 4. Now Finnish 
and Swedish lead by a wide margin, with roughly double the interest of the runner-up Nato languages of Polish and Croatian.

## Hegel was not right, causing limitations

The trend for correlating "nation" with "language" inspired by Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831) sadly still causes a desire to oversimplify. One cannot just simply 
talk about "NATO languages" and "non-NATO languages", and there are many shares of grey. English and French are spoken in several Nato/OTAN countries, 
but also outside Nato. Spanish and Portuguese have more native speakers outside Nato. German is mainly spoken in Nato (Germany, Italy) but also outside (Austria, 
Switzerland, Liechtenstein). Dutch is spoken in several Nato countries (Belgium, Netherlands). Swedish is spoken in several non-Nato countries (Sweden, Finland). 

## German readers are very interested in Nato

Among the big languages, the results are nearly as dramatic. German already for 2016-21 scored way above French and English on per-native-speaker readership. 
For the ten hot days starting 24.2.2022, the difference accentuates. German ranks overall number 7, with English being 21 and French 29. That said, the German
native speakers are more likely than English and French native speakers to live in a Nato membership country. 

## Ukrainian speakers are busy elsewhere

The fact that Ukrainian speakers rank number 30 should hardly be taken as a sign of passing interest in Nato. More so, that they are busy elsewhere than 
on Wikipedia.

## I hope the Russians love their NPOV, too

Russian speakers rank 20 on the list when put into proportion to the amount of native Russian speakers, with a growth of 44 on the interest of 
the Russian language article in Nato. Given the huge number of native speakers, Russian ranks number four after English, German and Spanish, if you
count the number of views in the ten days starting 24.2.2022.

Russian Wikipedia is still open and attempting to uphold the Neutral Point of View (NPOV) goal of Wikipedia. The Wikimedia Foundation noted it
"stands with its communities around the world in defending free knowledge in the face of threats from the Russian government", see

## Conclusions

One can fairly safely argue that reading the Wikipedia article on Nato is a measurement of the interest in Nato. Arguing that readership is an indication
of support of Nato membership is clearly not ironclad, but also no wild speculation.

Finland and Sweden currently have hot debates about Nato membership. However, both Finnish and Swedish speakers are unlikely to be aware that the Nato interest 
is by far higher than the Nato interest of readers in any other language. And this by a wide margin. Traditionally, Estonia is put forth as a country 
heavily relying on Nato – as witnessed also by their ranking 1 on Nato interest 2016-2021. However, Estonian speakers seem to have got what they wanted, dropping
to place 19 for the ten days starting 24.2.2022.

The fact that Finnish readers (with a measurement of 1280) rank above Swedish readers (with a measurement of 949) is unsurprising. The larger surprise is that
the difference is so insignificant. Given the relatively small proportion of the Swedish native speakers residing in Finland (<5 % Finland and >95 % Sweden),
it is safe to say that the interest for Nato in Sweden is exceptionally high.

## Caveats on the reliability of the study

This study was not done by a university, a research institution or a think-tank. It was done by two developers who engage in a Wikipedia project, Projekt Fredrika,
centered around the representation of Swedish Finland on Wikipedia, in Swedish and other languages. These two developers (Kaj Arnö and Robert Silén) are not
primarily coders. Hence, we put out the code on Github, for others to verify.

In reading the results, we see anomalies, like Italian. The score for Italian is very low. This may be due to some peculiarities on how Nato has been 
represented on Italian Wikipedia. We did not take the time to study this closer. 

There are also minor anomalies. In Montenegro, the official language is Montenegrinian. But that language does not have a Wikipedia, partly for
political reasons, partly because the Serbocroatian Wikipedia is in wide use. Academic attention could increase the reliability of the study.
